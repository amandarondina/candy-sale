# candy-sale

This is a part of last year's JavaScriptmas, a free annual festive coding event hosted by the online coding school Scrimba.<br>
I decided to use the challanges as inspiration for simple coding projects.

## Day 6
 > It's the day after Halloween 🎃 and all the candy is on sale! To buy up all the candy, use map() and filter() to put all the candy into a `shoppingCart` array. The new array should contain only the item and the price, like this: 
   
   Expected output: 

```
[
       {item: "🍭", price: 2.99},
       {item: "🍫", price: 1.99}, 
       {item: "🍬", price: 0.89}
    ]
```
